    "If betting on red doesn't seem like a good idea, maybe a gambler might want to try a different bet. A bet on a *split* is a bet on two consecutive numbers such as 5 and 6. This bets pays 17 to 1. That means if you place a one-dollar bet on the split 5 and 6, then:\n",
    "\n",
    "- If the winning pocket is either 5 or 6, your gain is 17 dollars.\n",
    "- If any other pocket wins, you lose your dollar, so your gain is -1 dollars.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Question 7.** Define a function `dollar_bet_on_split` that takes a pocket number and returns your gain in dollars if that pocket won and you had bet one dollar on the 5-6 split. **(4 points)**\n",
