# üß† Foundations of Data Science

> UC Berkeley ‚Äî *Principles of inference, computation, and reasoning with data.*

This repository contains my completed labs, homework, and projects from **Foundations of Data Science (Data 8)** at UC Berkeley.  
It covers the fundamentals of **data analysis, probability, inference, visualization, and regression modeling** ‚Äî all implemented in Python using the `datascience` library and Jupyter Notebooks.
